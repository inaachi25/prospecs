## The WHAT
The modern job market has become increasingly competitive and unpredictable, leaving many individuals—especially young professionals and graduates—uncertain about where they fit in. Traditional job search methods are often time-consuming, generic, and offer little guidance in aligning one’s personal strengths with meaningful career paths. As a result, many settle for roles they are overqualified or underprepared for, leading to job dissatisfaction, high turnover rates, and career stagnation.

Moreover, access to information about industries, job requirements, salary expectations, and skill development remains fragmented. Without proper guidance, individuals are left to navigate a complex landscape alone, often making decisions based on limited knowledge or social pressure rather than informed choice.

This disconnect between individual potential and job market demands signals a broader issue—one that calls for more intelligent, personalized, and empowering approaches to career exploration and employment readiness.

## Problem
1. Finding Relevant Opportunities: Users struggle to identify and access opportunities that match their skills, interests, or career goals.
2. Lack of Feedback: There is minimal or no feedback provided to users about their applications or progress, making improvement difficult.
3. Limited Access to Information: Essential information about opportunities, requirements, or processes is often hard to find or unavailable.

## What would I have done differently
This project was actually a little bit of personal to me because it played a significant role before I entered college. I was that kid snooping around the internet, trying to find ways to upskill or learn new things. I was always curious about what I could do with my skills, and I wanted to find a platform that could help me explore different career paths.

I garnered a lot of job opportunity platforms worldwide in my Notion workspace and I thought, during the development of this project, why not pick an industry or field that I really know and understand. Prospecs was born. Overall, the project met the requirements of our professor. The project was presented well and was able to win second place during the design demo programme of my university.

Additionally, this is my first ever UI project that I was forced to learn Figma and do the project in one sitting @1am with no electricity due to a typhoon. Plus, the presentation is on the next day. I was able to finish it and present it well, but I know that there are still a lot of things that I can improve on.

I learned that I can do a lot of things if I put my mind to it. I also learned that I can be creative and think

## Learnings
PLANNING. PLANNING. PLANNING. Planning saves time in the execution of the project. Make your wireframes. Assess not only the design but with the functionality in the user perspective.
