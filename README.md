## The WHAT
The modern job market has become increasingly competitive and unpredictable, leaving many individuals—especially young professionals and graduates—uncertain about where they fit in. Traditional job search methods are often time-consuming, generic, and offer little guidance in aligning one’s personal strengths with meaningful career paths. As a result, many settle for roles they are overqualified or underprepared for, leading to job dissatisfaction, high turnover rates, and career stagnation.

Moreover, access to information about industries, job requirements, salary expectations, and skill development remains fragmented. Without proper guidance, individuals are left to navigate a complex landscape alone, often making decisions based on limited knowledge or social pressure rather than informed choice.

This disconnect between individual potential and job market demands signals a broader issue—one that calls for more intelligent, personalized, and empowering approaches to career exploration and employment readiness.

## Problem
1. Finding Relevant Opportunities: Users struggle to identify and access opportunities that match their skills, interests, or career goals.
2. Lack of Feedback: There is minimal or no feedback provided to users about their applications or progress, making improvement difficult.
3. Limited Access to Information: Essential information about opportunities, requirements, or processes is often hard to find or unavailable.
